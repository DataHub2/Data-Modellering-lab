3NF - My breakdown of the Data Model.

1NF:
The model ensures atomic values by using bridge tables (program_course) for exemple.
And it also ensures that every row remains unique.

2NF: 
The tables with composite keys, like (course_teacher), strictly contains the important foreign keys.
Without any unrelated non - key attributes, this is so i can prevent partial dependencies.

3NF:
All attributes depand only on the primary key. 

. Student: Students are only linked to class_id. I avoided to link to program_id
so that i can eliminate redundancy, beacuse the program is already via the class.

. Inheritance: The role specific attributes like the hourley_rate is isolated in the (Consultant) table,
instead of the parent (Person) table, this is so that the data depends on the specific entity.
